This project aims to build and deploy a quantitative finance dashboard designed to support portfolio managers with data-driven analysis tools.
The application retrieves financial market data dynamically, applies quantitative strategies and portfolio simulations, and presents results through an interactive web interface.

The project reproduces a professional quant workflow, combining Python development, Linux deployment, Git collaboration, and automated reporting.

#### Objectives

-Retrieve and update financial or economic data from public sources

-Visualize asset prices, strategies, and portfolio performance interactively
